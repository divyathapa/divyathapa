### Hi :arrow_right: I'm Divya :woman: and I am a Front End Developer.:arrow_down:

## My coding journey 


Back in 2019, I joined General Assembly's :turtle: Front End Web Development course and went from knowing nothing :expressionless: about web developement to knowing something:joy:.

I quit :sunglasses: my fulltime job as a Recruiter and started coding full-time :computer:


Besides coding, I believe in doing my bit :recycle: for the planet :earth_asia:, I love swimming and I have recently started yoga.

## Why should you reach out to me?
I am an Aries :aries:, which means I am fearless :no_entry_sign:and I don't shy away from any challenges :sweat_drops:.
I am highly motivated and goal oriented.
